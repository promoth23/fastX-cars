                The 2022 Chiron isn't only the ultimate Bugatti, it's the ultimate car. Period. This $3 million work of art is capable of pummeling the pavement at over 200 mph thanks to a 16-cylinder engine that features four turbochargers and cranks out at least 
                1500 horsepower—the more expensive Super Sport model is even more powerful. The Chiron's cabin is just as artfully designed as its exterior, and it coddles occupants in fine materials that help justify its price tag. But let's be honest, people are really paying for the performance here. Those looking for modern conveniences 
                (think Apple CarPlay) or driver-assistance tech, they won't find them here, but after driving this monster, they likely won't care about such minor. <br><br>

                There are plenty of ways to get dirty, but the Mercedes-Benz G-class is truly the fanciest way to crawl through the muck. Built like a champagne-sipping Ford Bronco or Jeep Wrangler, the Geländewagen has a lavish interior with massaging seats and a six-figure starting price to match. Every G550 is powered by a 416-hp twin-turbo V-8 with a nine-speed automatic transmission. Four-wheel drive is standard. For more power, there's the 577-hp AMG-badged G63, reviewed separately. The G Wagen is capable of wilder adventures than its occupants would likely volunteer for. Its 9.5 inches of ground clearance and three locking differentials make it feel as if it's unable to ever get stuck. Its boxy 
                shape results in a spacious cabin with plenty of legroom for every passengeR.<br><br>

                Few supercars actually get driven daily, but the 2023 Audi R8 seems designed for such a task. It offers a reasonably easy-going ride along with its breakneck acceleration. The R8 shares its underpinnings and its powertrain—a mighty V-10 and seven-speed automatic—with the wild Lamborghini Huracán. The Audi is less hardcore than the Lambo, though, less intense on a twisty road or racetrack. What the R8 offers instead is a level of refinement that’s more in line with the rest of the Audi lineup. Its snug, two-seat cabin is lined with high-end materials and features a minimalist design that forgoes the usual center-mounted infotainment display in favor of a digital gauge display that serves both purposes. The interior is comfortable for both driver and passenger, and the R8 would make a fine 
                touring car if it weren’t for a puny cargo area that fits only one carry-on suitcase. If this particular cross-section of performance and luxury appeals to you, now’s the time to act, as this is the final year for Audi’s V-10–powered showpiece.<br><br>

                The Rolls-Royce Phantom is the world’s most recognizable symbol of automotive extravagance and status. Its huge waterfall grille and classic upright proportions convey a simple and singular message: wealth goes here. Or maybe royalty. The 2023 Phantom also stands out in the ultimate-luxury car class for its price, which is hundreds of thousands higher than those of rivals such as the Bentley Flying Spur or the Mercedes-Maybach S-class. We can attest to the fact that slipping behind the Phantom’s wheel—better still, into its back seat through its rear-hinged coach doors—will make you feel like a member of the one-tenth-of-one-percent. To the Phantom’s credit, there’s probably not a more comfortable luxury car on the planet. It wafts down the road, floating serenely over pavement imperfections while pampering its passengers with an array of sumptuous interior materials. Meanwhile, its big V-12 engine hums away nearly silently under the 
                Phantom’s long hood, providing effortless power. There’s seemingly no end to the customization opportunities offered by the factory, either. The only thing missing from the options list is a chauffeur, but that feature is sold separately. <br><br>

                With a raucous 769-hp V-12 engine and an exotic exterior, the 2022 Lamborghini Aventador is the definition of a hyper car. While competitors such as the Ferrari SF90 embrace an electrified future, the Lambo's 12-cylinder mill swills fuel like a frat bro chugs a beer. Its scissor doors, wide and low proportions, and heavily vented bodywork double as a theater on wheels that's perpetually playing the Fast and Furious movies. Inside, its highly customizable cabin has room for two riders, but there's very little space to store loose items. Behind the wheel, the driver can activate the Aventador's shrieking soundtrack with a stab of their right foot or experience the massive machine's surprising agility by twirling the tiller. 
                While its obsolete automatic transmission is almost as frustrating as the roadster's cumbersome roof removal, those are but a small penance for the 2022 Aventador's otherwise awesome powers and unmistakable style. <br><br>

                Whether you come from old money or you’re nouveau riche, there’s no better way to flaunt it than in a Rolls-Royce Ghost. This is a car with presence, a car for the one tenth of one percent. And everyone knows it. The Gh
                ost mimics the even more expensive Phantom sedan in both style and substance, offering an interior that’s whisper quiet and impeccably outfitted with the finest materials. It’s equipped with coach rear doors, just like the Phantom, that open like a pair of welcoming arms—a clear signal of upper-crust luxury. The ride is as smooth as polished aluminum, just like in other Rolls-Royces. But there’s also more athleticism tuned into the chassis than you might expect—especially on the Black Badge model, which comes with more power and sportier settings for the Ghost’s standard air suspension. Would you rather be chauffeured? No problem; riding in the Ghost’s rear compartment is a sybaritic experience as well. <br><br>

                The 2022 Mercedes-Benz A-class is a small car with the heart of an S-class luxury sedan. The expensive-looking façade helps it look right at home among the rest of the Benz lineup, and its modern, tech-filled cabin delivers much the same experience as pricier models. A turbocharged four-cylinder drives either the front or all four wheels, and the A-class's handling is fairly spry. We'll admit that it's not as quick as the related AMG-tuned CLA35, but it's still engaging to drive. Compared to ri
                vals such as the BMW 2-series Gran Coupe and the Cadillac CT4, the A-class offers a more cohesive package and is more desirable than either of those entry-level luxury compact cars. <br><br>

Want to maximize the cool factor? Try the two-door 90 model. Have a slew of kids to shuttle around town? The extended-wheelbase 130 model offers more space and a usable third row of seats. Most buyers will likely prefer the mid-sized 110 trim, as it offers similar proportions to the 90 with a bit more practicality. No matter whic

It rides on the same platform as other elegant beasts of burden such as the Audi Q7, Q8, Porsche Cayenne, and the Bentley Bentayga. Even the 657-hp twin-turbo V-8 is made in Germany before getting shipped to Sant'Agata Bolognese, where the Urus is assembled. An upcoming hybrid powertrain will double down on the Urus's saddle of electronics. From

                Toyota's halo sports car, the 2023 GR Supra, delivers enough excitement, style, and drama to make up for the brand's more sedate sedans, hatchbacks, and SUVs. Developed and built alongside the BMW Z4 convertible, the GR Supra offers similar build quality and simpler—but still handsome—interior materials inside. The entry-level 255-hp turbocharged four-cylinder provides ample power, but we can't help but adore the ferocious, optional 382-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter BMW inline-six that makes this two-seater fly.
                 Rear-wheel drive is the only setup, and the GR Supra's sure-footed chassis and sharp steering enable it to come alive on twisty roads and race courses.<br><br>
